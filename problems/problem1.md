A solid square bar of cross-sectional dimensions  50mm x 50 mm is attached rigidly to the wall at point A and has a gap of 1 mm  from the rigid wall at point B at $25^\circ C$.  

![rigid bar attached to wall A, with a small gap between right edge of bar and wall B](deforms_figure.png)

Knowing the bar is made of aluminum $E = 70 GPa$, $\alpha = 23 * 10^{-6}$ :

1.  At what temperature does the gap close? 
2.  What stress exists in the bar at a temperature of $100^\\circ C$?'
